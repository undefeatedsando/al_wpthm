Hi.

Thank you for downloading our Webfish theme. Feel free to continue 
developing it. If you have a suggestion to a improvement please 
contact us on www.webfish.se/contact. Apart from this readme, we 
will not give any developing support. 


All our Webfish themes are SEO-optimize and (hopefully) 
"develop-optimized". The only thing a theme developer needs to 
change is the controller switchers in functions.php and the CSS 
(theme_appaerance.css and theme_design.css). All needed HTML 
tags we can think of is there already. If you want to add some 
functionality to the theme, please reconsider writing a plugin 
instead. 

It is completely optional, but if you like the theme we would
appreciate it if you keep the credit link at the bottom, 
that is the only way we are getting credit 
for the hundreds of hours we spent to creating this theme.
